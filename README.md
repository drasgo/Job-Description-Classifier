Job Description Classifier.

This project was presented at the 2021 Randstad Artificial Intelligence Challenge competition. 

The system is based on the BERT classifier trained on italian corpora. The data is pre-processed by stemming and 
lemmatizing the text. 

The input to the system is a job description, given in csv format, and the expected output is one of multiple
classes (namely 'Java Developer', 'Software Engineer', 'Web Developer', 'System Analyst', 'Programmer'). The final 
accuracy obtained was 82%.
